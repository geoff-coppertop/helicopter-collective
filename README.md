# helicopter-collective

I started this project by pieceing together,

- the [example for the RP2040](https://archive.hannobraun.com/embedded-rust/getting-started/)
- this [embassy quickstart template](https://github.com/9names/embassy-rp-quickstart/tree/embassy-rp-0.3-rp235x)

I've lifted individual hardware examples from,

- the [embassy rp235x examples](examples/rp235x)
- the [sparkfun tmag5273 arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_TMAG5273_Arduino_Library)

This project uses similar hardware to implement a [3D mouse](https://github.com/sb-ocr/diy-spacemouse).
